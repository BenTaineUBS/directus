# Documentation

> TK

This module is an internal set of guides, concepts, and reference docs for your project's specific version of Directus.
It also includes a dynamic [API Reference](/reference/api/introduction) that is dynamically tailored to your custom
schema. The docs are organized into these distinct sections:

- [Getting Started](/getting-started/introduction/) — Novice oriented, for a platform intro and installation.
- [Concepts](/concepts/activity) — Learning oriented, for understanding the platform.
- [Guides](/guides/api-config) — Problem oriented, follow along with steps while working.
- [Reference](/reference/command-line-interface) — Information oriented, look up info and specs while working.
- [API Reference](/reference/api/introduction/) — Information oriented, look up API resources while working.
- [Contributing](/contributing/introduction/) — Contributor oriented — resources for working on Open-Source Core.
