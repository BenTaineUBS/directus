## Activity Log

This module provides a collective timeline of all actions taken within the project. This is a great way to audit user
activity or enforce accountability. This is the only system module that is not in the module bar by default â€” instead
being located within the notifications tray of the page sidebar. This page has the same features and configuration as
[Collection Detail](#collection-detail).

### Activity Detail

Unlike other item detail pages, activity items are **readonly** (for proper accountability) and open in a side drawer to
display the [Activity Fields](/concepts/activity/#activity-fields).
