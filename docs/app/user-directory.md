# User Directory

> [Users](/getting-started/glossary#users) are the individual accounts for logging in to the App. Each user belongs to a
> [Role](/getting-started/glossary#roles) which defines its [Permissions](/getting-started/glossary#permissions). The
> User Directory shows all users within the project, each with their own customizable profile page.

## User Directory Overview

::: tip System Fields

Administrators have access to additional system fields.

### Administrators vs Other Users

You can access your profile page from the User Directory or by clicking the User Menu in the
[Module Bar](/app/overview/#_1-module-bar). The profile page has the same features and functionality as the
[Item Page](/app/content-items/). Administrators can customize the fields on this page, but the following are available
by default.

### Viewing a User

<video title="Descriptive Title Goes Here" autoplay muted loop controls>
<source src="www.example.com/example.mp4" />
<p>Your browser is not displaying the video for some reason. Here's a <a href="www.example.com/example.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

Users are referenced throughout the app, often for accountability purposes. Hovering over a user in this context will
provide a popover for basic information, and clicking that popover will navigate you to a read-only view of that user's
profile page.
