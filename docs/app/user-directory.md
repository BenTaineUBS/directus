# User Directory

> [Users](/getting-started/glossary#users) are the individual accounts for logging in to the App. Each user belongs to a
> [Role](/getting-started/glossary#roles) which defines its [Permissions](/getting-started/glossary#permissions). The
> User Directory shows all users within the project, each with their own customizable profile page.

## Browsing Users

::: tip Collection Page This page has the same features and functionality as the
[Collection Page](/app/content/collection). :::

Lists all users of the project, with a navigation that allows quick access to the different role groups. This page has

## Viewing a User

provide a popover for basic information, and clicking that popover will navigate you to a readonly view of that user's
profile page.
