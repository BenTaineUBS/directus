::: tip Assumed Knowledge

The controls to create, view, edit and delete Items in this Module are quite intuitive. However, to use the Module
effectively in all its nuances, you will need to know about creating [Collections](/configuration/data-model) and
[Filters](/app/filters), as well as understand how configuration of
[Users, Roles and Permissions](/configuration/users-roles-permissions/) impacts content access for non-Administrators.
