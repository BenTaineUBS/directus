# Installing Extensions

There are two possible ways to install extensions to your Directus instance:

1. Installing through NPM
2. Installing through the Extensions Folder

## Installing through NPM

If you wish to install an existing public extension, package extensions are essentially npm packages that can be
installed from the npm registry. Before you begin, ensure you have a
[self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on your system.

**1. Modify docker-compose.yml**

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file of your project and modify the build section:

```yaml
build:
  context: ./
```

This allows Docker to build your project with the necessary dependencies.

**2. Create a Dockerfile**

At the root of your project, create a `Dockerfile` if one doesn't already exist and add the following:

```Dockerfile
FROM directus/directus:latest

USER root
RUN corepack enable \
 && corepack prepare pnpm@8.7.6 --activate

USER node
RUN pnpm install directus-extension-package-name
```

::: tip Extension Name

Remember to replace `directus-extension-package-name` with the name of the extension you want to install. For example,
`directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Build the Docker Image**

Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker compose --build
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

On startup, you'd see that Directus will automatically load any package extension installed into your Directus project
folder.

## Installing Through the Extensions Folder

To locally install extensions, copy the files generated by the `directus-extension build` command into the 'extensions'
folder located at the root of your Directus project.

::: warning Configurable Folders

The path to the built extension as well as the extensions directory are configurable and may be located elsewhere.

:::

Before you begin, ensure you have a [self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on
your system.

**1. Create an Extension Folder**

At the root of your project, create an "extensions" folder if one doesn't already exist to house your extension.

**2. Add your new extension into the extensions folder**

Move the output from the `dist/` folder into the extensions folder you created earlier.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```yaml
extensions
  <extension-name>/
    dist/
      index.js
    src
      index.js
      interface.vue
  displays/
  hooks/
  endpoints/
  ...
```

::: tip Extension Name Format

Ensure your extension is prefixed with `directus-extension`. For example, `directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Update Docker Compose File**

Open your `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following to mount your extension into the Docker container:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./extensions:/directus/extensions/
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You should see that your extension has been successfully loaded into the Docker container. Now, go ahead to customize
your extension by making changes to the `src` folder within your extension directory.

::: tip Automatically Reload Extensions

To automatically reload extensions every time you make a change, without having to restart Directus, in your
`docker-compose.yml` file, set `EXTENSIONS_AUTO_RELOAD=true`.
