# Installing Extensions

There are two possible ways to install extensions to your Directus instance:

1. Installing through NPM
2. Installing through the Extensions Folder

## Installing through NPM

Package extensions are essentially npm packages that can be installed from the npm registry. Before you begin, ensure
you have a [self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on your system.

**1. Modify docker-compose.yml**

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file of your project and modify the build section:

```yaml
build:
  context: ./
```

This allows Docker to build your project with the necessary dependencies.

**2. Create a Dockerfile**

At the root of your project, create a `Dockerfile` if one doesn't already exist and add the following:

```Dockerfile
FROM directus/directus:latest

USER root
RUN corepack enable \
 && corepack prepare pnpm@8.3.1 --activate

USER node
RUN pnpm install directus-extension-package-name
```

::: tip Extension Name

Remember to replace `directus-extension-package-name` with the name of the extension you want to install. For example,
`directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Build the Docker Image**

Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

On startup, you'd see that Directus will automatically load any package extension installed into your Directus project
folder.

::: tip Automatically Reload Extensions

To automatically reload extensions every time you make a change, without having to restart Directus, in your
`docker-compose.yml` file, set `EXTENSIONS_AUTO_RELOAD=true`.

:::

## Installing Through the Extensions Folder

Local extensions are essentially the files generated by the `directus-extension build` command. They can be installed by
copying those files into the extensions folder at the root of your Directus project.

::: warning Configurable Folders

The path to the built extension as well as the extensions directory are configurable and may be located elsewhere.

:::

Before you begin, ensure you have a [self-hosted instance of Directus](/self-hosted/quickstart) via Docker installed on
your system.

**1. Create an Extension Folder**

At the root of your project, create an "extensions" folder if one doesn't already exist to house your extension.

**2. Add your new extension into the extensions folder**

Move the output from the `dist/` folder into the extensions folder you created earlier.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```yaml
extensions
  <extension-name>/
    dist/
      index.js
    src
      index.js
      interface.vue
  displays/
  hooks/
  endpoints/
  ...
```

::: tip Extension Name Format

Ensure your extension is prefixed with `directus-extension`. For example, `directus-extension-myextension`.

:::

**3. Update Docker Compose File**

Open your `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following to mount your extension into the Docker container:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./extensions:/directus/extensions/
```

**4. Start the Docker Container**

Start your Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see that your extension has been successfully loaded into the Docker container. Now, go ahead to customize
your extension by making changes to the `src` folder within your extension directory.
