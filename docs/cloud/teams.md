Bills are project-based, accrued on an hourly basis and invoiced monthly. Terms of Service. Teams and Accounts are free
and not billable. When a Standard Project is created, thatâ€™s the beginning of the billing cycle. Priced and metered per
hour per node. 5 days = 5 days. 100 days = monthly bill. Point to pricing page on dashboard. Active + standby nodes.
Node hours running. For more information, refer to [Cloud Policies](https://directus.io/cloud-policies/#) for detailed
