Directus Cloud Accounts are how individuals access the platform. Creating an account is easy and free. As mentioned in
the [Overview](/cloud/overview/), to make life easy, you have the option to create and login to your free Cloud Account
automatically with Github. If you have no Github or do not wish to use this login method, email-and-password login is
available as well. In either case, simply go to the [login page](https://directus.cloud/login) and follow the prompts as
desired.
