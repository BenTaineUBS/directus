Creating an Account is easy and free. As mentioned in the [Overview](/cloud/overview/), to make life easy, you have the
option to create and login to your free Cloud Account automatically with Github. If you have no Github or do not wish to
use this login method, email-and-password login is available as well. In either case, simply go to the
[Login Page](https://directus.cloud/login) and follow the prompts as desired.
