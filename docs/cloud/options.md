## Node Type

### General Purpose Tier

The nodes in the packages will serve the needs for most projects.

**Data-processing** – **Parallel Operations** – **Asset Support** –

### Performance Tier

Provides higher-powered Node.

**Data-processing** – **Parallel Operations** – **Asset Support** –

## Load Balancing

Details on Load Balancing

- Horizontal scaling = active nodes
- $25/mo…. 3 nodes @ $25/mo.
- Instantaneously distribute load across multiple servers.
- @60-70% within a few minutes the autoscale nodes come online
- Spike = active nodes
- Increase = active nodes

## Auto-Scaling

### Standby Node Pricing

## Enterprise Tier

as Enterprise Projects cannot be created directly from the Cloud Dashboard.

However, here are some basic options on Enterprise Projects.

- Enterprise: Remote database access coming soon! Contact us.
- 15+ regions
- Use copy from website/cloud etc.
