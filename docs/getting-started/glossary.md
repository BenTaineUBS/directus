## Title Formatter

Special Casing â€” If you are trying to update the specific casing (uppercase/lowercase) for a word (eg: `Dna` to `DNA`)
you will want to add the edge-case to the
[Format Title package](https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/main/packages/format-title/src). If you feel the case
passes our [80/20 rule](https://docs.directus.io/contributing/introduction/#feature-requests) you should submit a Pull
Request to the codebase, otherwise you can update this in your instance.

they have access to see and do. This means that the experience of users may vary significantly depending on their role's
permissions.
