# Permissions

> Permissions are attached directly to a Role, defining what Users can create, read, update, and delete within the platform. [Learn more about Permissions](#).

## Configuring Role Permissions

Directus possesses an extremely granular, yet easy to configure, permissions system. When creating a new role,
permissions are disabled for all project collections by default â€” allowing you to give explicit access to only what is
required. Individual permissions are applied to the role, and each is scoped to a specific collection and CRUD action
(create, read, update, delete).

::: warning Saves Automatically

Every change made to the permissions of a role is saved automatically and instantly.

::: warning Admin Roles

If a role is set to **Admin Access** then it is granted complete access to the platform, and therefore the permission
configuration field is disabled.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Roles & Permissions > [Role Name]**
2. Scroll to the **Permissions** section
3. **Click the icon** for the collection (row) and action (column) you want to set
4. Choose the desired permission level: **All Access**, **No Access**, or **Use Custom**

**If you selected "All Access" or "No Access" then setup is complete.** If you chose to customize permissions then continue with the appropriate guide below based on the relevant _action_.

## Configuring System Permissions

In addition to setting permissions for your project's collections, you can also tailor the permissions for system
collections. It is important to note that when [App Access](/concepts/users-roles-and-permissions) is enabled for a
role, Directus will automatically add permission for the necessary system collections. To edit system permissions,
simply click the "System Collections" toggle, and then edit permissions using the same steps as with project
collections.

::: tip Resetting System Permissions

To reset the role's system permissions for proper App access, expand the system collections and then click "Reset System
Permissions" at the bottom of the listing.
