# Contributing

Heya! Welcome to Directus, and thank you for taking the time to contribute back to our project! ❤️

There's many ways in which you can contribute, but before you do, please make sure you're aware of
[the Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct). Our contributors and maintainers work extremely hard to build
Directus as premium open-source software. Please be respectful of those efforts throughout our ecosystem. **Trolling,
harassing, insulting, or other unacceptable behavior by participants will not be tolerated.**

## Report a Bug

If you happen to run into a bug, please post an Issue on our main GitHub Issue board:
https://github.com/directus/directus/issues

Please be as explicit and detailed as you can in the bug report. The more information available, the easier it is for
other contributors to help you find the solution or fix. Consider adding a schema snapshot file, or a database dump.

## Request a New Feature

If you have a great idea for an improvement of the platform, or any other feedback, please make sure to open a new
Discussion on our GitHub Discussions board: https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions. Feature requests are
reviewed and triaged according to our feature request workflow. For more information, please see:

<Card

	text="Feature requests are reviewed and triaged according to this process"

## Answer Questions

The Directus community is growing quickly, which also means there's more and more people that have questions. Helping
out your fellow developers by answering questions on [Discord](https://directus.chat) or
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/categories/q-a) is a great way to help the
project.

## Create a Pull Request

The whole Directus project is open source, and community code contributions are very welcome! Fixing issues or
implementing new features is a great way to contribute back to the platform.

Please do make sure you read through our Pull Request Process before you start! That ensures that you have the highest
chance that your code suggestion will make it to the core codebase swiftly.

## Report Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security issue within a Directus product or service, please reach out to us
directly over email: [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io). We will then open a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories) for tracking the fix.

We value the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work with our
team so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release notes. In
order to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:

- They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Directus team releasing a fix for it
- They do not divulge exact details of the issue, e.g., through exploits or proof-of-concepts

## Translate the App

Every button, element, or other line of text in the app is fully translatable. These translations make our app an
international platform. Our [Crowdin integration](https://locales.directus.io) makes polishing existing translations or
creating new ones a breeze.
