# Request a Feature

If you have a great idea for an improvement of the platform, or any other feedback, please make sure to open a new
Discussion on our GitHub Discussions board: https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions

## Opening a new Feature Request

New feature requests can be opened under the Draft Requests section of
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions). Feature Requests follow a Request-for-Comments
format that allows anybody to fully understand what you're proposing, and help speed up the review and triaging process.

**While the form might seem intimidating at first, please do fill out all sections in as much detail as you can. The
less ambiguity exists around _how_ a feature should work, the easier it is to review, triage, and subsequently develop a
feature.**

## Review Process

Once a feature request gets 15 or more upvotes, it will be moved to the "Under Review" status at which point the
Directus Core team will review it to decide if it will be approved, denied, or if changes are required. Once the feature
request is accepted, it will be moved to the "Approved Requests" status, at which point the feature is ready to be
implemented.

However, if a feature request didn't reach the required 15 upvotes after 3 months of time, it will be closed due to a
lack of community interest.

## Implementing Accepted Feature Requests

It's important to note that Accepted Feature Requests are _not_ an ordered list of things that will be worked on next.
Even though we strive to prioritize what's being worked on based on community feedback, it's not unlikely that there
will be instances where a feature request is blocked by something else which means that something else will get
prioritized. The implementation of accepted feature request is triaged based on a combination of popularity, team
availability, timelines, scope of the feature, and overall project goals.
