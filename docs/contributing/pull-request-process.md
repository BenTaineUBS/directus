# Pull Request Process

Pull Requests (PRs) are a fantastic way to contribute back to a project. It's one of the fastest ways to see a bug fix
or new feature you care about land in the platform.

Reviewing and maintaining community submitted code is a very time consuming process. To ensure the core team can give
every PR the tender love and care it deserves, and not have valuable PRs to stale, we require that:

**Every pull request must be in answer to an existing open [Issue](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues).**

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues) as a living to-do list of tasks we want to work on
next. Requiring PRs to implement Issues makes sure that your PR aligns with the core team's planning and long-term
goals. Please leave a comment on the issue you're preparing a PR for, so you can be assigned which makes sure nobody
else will work on the same thing at the same time.

## Choosing What to Implement

We welcome PRs for any [Issue](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues). Issues labeled
["Community"](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:Community) have been identified as
good improvements or fixes for a community PR, as they're often a little more scoped in what parts they affect, which
makes it easier to implement and reviews. Issues labeled
["Good First Issue"](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22Good+First+Issue%22) should
be easy to resolve, and are therefore a great starting point if you haven't contributed to the codebase before.

## Implementing an Accepted Feature Request

If you're looking to implement a feature request that hasn't been transferred to an issue yet, please contact the core
team through a comment on the feature request before starting your PR. There's probably a good reason why it wasn't
marked as ready-to-be-implemented yet, be it unknown timelines, conflicts with other projects, blockers, etc. By
collaborating early, we make sure the PR can actually be merged!
