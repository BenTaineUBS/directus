## Local Development

<!-- Directus API Service -->

1. Run `pnpm i` at the root `directus` folder.
2. Run `pnpm -r build` at the root `directus` folder.
3. Navigate to `/api`
4. Create a ENV file named `.env`
   - You can populate the environment variables from
     [Configuration Files](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html#configuration-files)
     - **Note:** You will need to add at the Database config variables, along with the `KEY` & `SECRET`.
5. Run `pnpm cli database install`
6. Run `pnpm cli database migrate:latest` to run all migrations for the database.
7. Run `pnpm cli roles create --role Administrator --admin` to create an admin role. This will return the id value for
   the role created.
8. Run `pnpm cli users create --email <email> --password <password> --role <role_id>` to create a new admin user and
   return the user id.
   - Example:
     `pnpm cli users create --email email@directus.io --password secret_password --role b0600d5c-b768-4bbc-a8e4-49e89d35748a `
9. Run `pnpm dev` to start the API service.

<!-- Directus Admin App -->

1. Navigate to `/app`.
2. Create a ENV file named `.env.development`.
   - You can populate the environment variables from
     [Configuration Files](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html#configuration-files)
3. Run `pnpm -r run build` to build all required package dependencies.
4. Navigate to `/app` and run `pnpm dev`.
5. Navigate to your local Directus URL, and login with the credentials you just created.

### Changing Local Database with Docker

- To change from a local `sqlite` database, you can use anyone of the supported databases in the root
  [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) by running `docker compose up -d postgres redis minio`.

**Note:** If you are trying to run `postgres` on a M1/M2 MacBook (arm64), you will need to change the postgres image to
be `image: ghcr.io/baosystems/postgis:13-3.3` and include `platform: linux/arm64`. (This is not officially supported,
but provided as a work around).
