Due to a bug introduced in v10.6.2, Field Conditions were applied incorrectly. This has been corrected and works again as expected.
If you have edited Field Conditions under this version, please refer to https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/19757#issuecomment-1734162756 for instructions to fix the Conditions.
